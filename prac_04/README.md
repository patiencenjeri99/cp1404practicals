# Practical 04
### Reflection
This week I learned how to use lists in Python to store and manage data. I also practiced looping through lists, reading from files, and using list comprehensions to make my code shorter and cleaner.

At first, I struggled a bit with generating random numbers and sorting them in the quick picks task, but after testing a few times, it started to make more sense.

Overall, I’ve realised how useful lists are for handling data, and I’m starting to feel more confident writing code that actually solves real problems.
