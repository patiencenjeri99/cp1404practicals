# Practical 09
This practical helped me understand how inheritance works and why it’s useful. Creating Taxi, UnreliableCar, and SilverServiceTaxi showed me how a child class can reuse the parent class’s code and then add or override behaviour when needed. I also learnt the difference between class variables and instance variables, and why some values should be shared across all objects.

The Band exercise helped me see the difference between inheritance and association. Instead of one class becoming another, a Band “has” Musicians, and each Musician “has” Instruments. This made it clearer when to use each type of relationship.

Overall, this prac made inheritance and class design much easier to understand.
